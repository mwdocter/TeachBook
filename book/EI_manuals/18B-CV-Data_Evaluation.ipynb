    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notebook 18B contains a set of guidelines for evaluating data acquired with the Pico Pi - based Potentiostat and saved as a file on a computer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A restricted implementation of the typical *Python* modules like *numpy* and *matplotlib* in the *Alpaca Kernel (Micropython)* significantly reduce the flexibility and the possibilities offered by these powerful modules forcing us to migrate some tasks to a *Python*-driven notebook (ipykernel) for evaluation of the results from the Potentiostat. Separating data evaluation from the data acquisition environment is nevertheless a common workflow in many commercially available devices, and one of the perhaps unexpected and advantageous outcomes of this approach is that the processed data becomes easily available for sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this short notebook as an inspiration and an example. The methods chosen for this notebook are not mandatory, and all *Python* tools are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "   \n",
    "   > - Import and extract data saved as a file\n",
    "   > - Plot a voltammogram \n",
    "   > - Prepare a workflow for week 19\n",

    "### Requirements\n",

    "   >1. ❗❗❗ = Mandatory\n",
    "   >2. 🏆 = Entirely optional - It is interesting and leads to a deeper understanding. \n",
    "   >3. 🏆🏆 = Optional. Recommended - It can be re-visited later. \n",
    "   >4. 🏆🏆🏆 = Recommended - It is relevant now. \n",
    "   >5. 🏆🏆🏆🐐 = Strongly recommended - It might be challenging, but it is surely worth the effort!\n",
    "   >\n",
    "   > Note: The number of trophies (🏆) indicates the level of recomendation for the optional tasks. It does not correlate with the level of difficulty. "

    "**Theory:** Now that we are connected to the ALPACA, you can explore **digital output**. By using the digital output function of the ALPACA, the voltages of the `Dout` pins (0-3) can be individually set to either 0 or +5 volts. Programming the ALPACA to this end is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from machine import Pin\n",
    "Dout0 = Pin(14, Pin.OUT) # Dout0 = GP14, hence id=14. The \"Dout0\" is easy to remember\n",

Notice that in the second line, we see a mysterious number.`14` is the pin number. This number specifies which pin to turn on or off. **You can find the pin number by looking at the Cria board**: notice that each `DoutX` is followed by the text `GPXX`, the pin number corresponds to whatever number follows `GP`. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Besides digital output, the Alpaca also supports **digital input**. This means that the ALPACA can sense whether or not a pin is raised to a \"high\" value of +5 volts (On) or a \"low\" value of 0 volts (Off). This is done in a similar fashion as digital output, but instead with `Pin.IN`. Consider the example below:\n",

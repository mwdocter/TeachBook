    "\n",
    "In this part of the practicals we occupy ourselves with interfaces directly between the real analog world and the PC. Both directions are covered: the conversion of an analog signal outside the PC into a digital representation of the signal inside the PC by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and conversely by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). You can thus directly input an analog voltage to the interface or output an analog voltage from it. The interface is usually executed as a plug-in board with an edge connector that is plugged into an expansion slot of the PC. This type of interface is described with the term data-acquisition board. The DAQ-board is not an independent measuring device; it has no display and no own power supply, and is always used in combination with a PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note: the DAQ board is in the PC. Whenever you want to use the DAQ card through Python/Jupyter notebook (like this assignment) you will need to download the jupyter notebook file on the classroom PC and run it locally.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the board also has provisions for digital I/O, where the conversion of the digital representation inside the PC to a digital signal outside the PC and vice versa takes place. For this, so-called I/O ports and I/O lines are used. On the board counters and timers are present for the timing of signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we use the NI PCI-6221 DAQ board of National Instruments. You can find this board next to your computer. \n",
